## Installation 💻

To install this app, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from [here]. You also need to have the datetime module, which is a built-in module in Python. You can check if you have the datetime module by running the following command in your terminal:

```python3
python3 -c "import datetime"
```

If you don't get any error message, you have the datetime module installed. If you get an error message, you need to install the datetime module by running the following command in your terminal:

After you have Python 3 and the datetime module installed, you can download the loan_calculator.py file from this repository and save it in your preferred location. You can also clone this repository by running the following command in your terminal:

## Usage 🚀

To use this app, you need to run the loan_calculator.py file in your terminal. You can do this by navigating to the directory where you saved the file and running the following command:

```

The app will greet you and ask for your name. Then, it will ask you a series of questions about your loan preferences. You need to enter your answers according to the instructions given by the app. For example, you need to enter 1 or 2 for some questions, and enter a valid number or date for other questions. The app will validate your input and handle any errors. After you enter all the required information, the app will calculate and display the results for you. It will also ask you if that would be all for now. You can enter 1 for yes or 2 for no. If you enter 1, the app will thank you and exit. If you enter 2, the app will ask you what else you would like to do or otherwise transfer you to a customer care representative.
